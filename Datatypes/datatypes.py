# Data Types in Python
#Following are the major data types in python
# 1) int -immutable
# 2) float -immutable
# 3) string -immutable
# 4) boolean -immutable True / False
# 5) complex - immutable a+bj format
# 6) list -[] mutable, indexing, duplicates , ordered , hetrogeneous
# 7) tuple-(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) it as same as list , but immutable.
# 8) dict-({name:'shyam', age:10, gender:'male'})- Empty set is dict, key ,value pairs
# 9) set-{} 
# 10) frozenset -immutable
# 11) byte -immutable To represent sequence of byte from [0 to 255]
# 12) bytearray - mutable
# 13) range - range(0,100,2)

elems = {10,20,30,40,50}
# l = list(elems)
# # Though the data type is list , but still the elements inside it are set so they are unordered.
# for i in l:
#     print(i)
# print(type(l))
# Output:
# 40
# 10
# 50
# 20
# 30
# <class 'list'>
# Simple Rule to Remember
# Default direction of list is forward.
# if the index is poistive then it should move in forward direction.
# if the index is negative then it should move in the reverse direction.
