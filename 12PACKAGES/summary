1) packages are nothing but group of modules
2) packages provides us readability , modularity and encapsulation.
3) we need to mention __init__.py file in the every package folder
4) __init__.py this files acts as initalizer , if we want to print /call any methods inside the package 
or perform anything then we need to write the code inside it.
5) Calling of the package are to be performed from the parallel directory only.

install
|
|-- test.py
com
 |
 |--  __init.py__
 |--  filename.py 
    |    
    |--faveheal
            |-- __init.py__
            |-- calculator.py


calculator.py can only be executed if test.py resides in the install directory , but if we want to make it execute global then we need to make it as package.

To convert it to package we need to take help of setuptools module
1) create a filename setup.py int the directory
2) call the function setup()
3) setup takes following arguments(name="",version="",packages=favehea])
Either we can declarre in that way or we can take help of find_packages from setup tools
from setuptools import find_packages.
4) setup takes following arguments(name="",version="",packages=find_packages())
